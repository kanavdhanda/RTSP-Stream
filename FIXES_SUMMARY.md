# RTSP Stream Server - Fixed Version Summary

## Problem Fixed
The Go server was panicking with "close of closed channel" when clients disconnected or reconnected. This happened because multiple goroutines were trying to close the same client channel simultaneously.

## Changes Made to `main.go`

### 1. **Client Structure Enhanced**
- Added `closed` boolean flag and `mu sync.Mutex` to prevent double-closure
- Thread-safe client state management

### 2. **RemoveClient Method Fixed**
- Added protection against double removal using mutex locks
- Safe channel closing with closed state checking
- Commented out auto-cleanup option (can be enabled if needed)

### 3. **StopStream Method Improved**
- Added graceful FFmpeg shutdown with small delay
- Safe client disconnection with closed state checking
- Better cleanup logging

### 4. **Frame Distribution Enhanced**
- Added checks for closed clients before sending frames
- Better error handling with defer logging
- Protected against sending to closed channels

### 5. **Client Pump Methods Fixed**
- **readPump**: Added check for already closed clients to prevent double removal
- **writePump**: Added closed state checking before writing frames and pings
- Better error handling and graceful cleanup

### 6. **New HTTP Endpoints**
- **GET /api/streams/:streamId** - Stop stream only if no clients connected (returns 409 if clients exist)
- **DELETE /api/streams/:streamId/force** - Force stop stream regardless of connected clients
- Better error responses with client count information

### 7. **Enhanced Frame Buffer Handling**
- Added channel closure checking in `handleGetFrame`
- Better timeout and error handling

## Changes Made to `js_client.js`

### 1. **Improved Error Handling**
- Request timeouts for all HTTP calls
- Better WebSocket error detection and handling
- Canvas setup error handling

### 2. **Enhanced Connection Management**
- Heartbeat mechanism to keep connections alive
- Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Prevention of multiple simultaneous reconnection attempts
- Clean disconnection with proper close codes

### 3. **New Methods Added**
- `forceStopStream()` - Force stop streams with connected clients
- `listStreams()` - Get list of all active streams
- `getConnectionStatus()` - Get detailed connection status
- Better statistics tracking with reconnection count

### 4. **React Hook Enhanced**
- Reconnection state tracking
- Server stats fetching
- Manual reconnect functionality
- Force stop option
- Better error state management

### 5. **Example Usage**
- Created comprehensive examples for different use cases
- Error handling patterns
- Multi-stream management
- Stream lifecycle management

## New Files Created

### 1. **client_example.html**
- Complete working example of the JavaScript client
- Real-time statistics display
- Connection status indicators
- All functionality demonstrated
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Key Benefits

### Server Side
- **No more panics** - Fixed the "close of closed channel" issue completely
- **Better resource management** - Proper cleanup of clients and streams
- **Graceful shutdowns** - FFmpeg processes are stopped cleanly
- **Client protection** - Streams won't stop if other clients are connected
- **Force stop option** - Admin can force stop streams when needed

### Client Side
- **Robust reconnection** - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Better error handling** - Detailed error reporting and recovery
- **Connection monitoring** - Heartbeat and status tracking
- **Resource cleanup** - Proper disposal of resources
- **Flexible usage** - Easy to integrate into existing applications

## Usage Examples

### Basic Server Usage
```bash
# Start the server
./rtsp-server

# Server will run on :8091 with the following endpoints:
# POST /api/streams/start-with-url - Start stream (recommended)
# DELETE /api/streams/:streamId - Stop stream (safe)
# DELETE /api/streams/:streamId/force - Force stop stream
# GET /api/streams - List all streams
# GET /api/streams/:streamId/stats - Get stream stats
# WS /ws/:streamId - WebSocket for real-time frames
```

### Basic Client Usage
```javascript
const client = new RTSPStreamClient('ws://localhost:8091');

// Start stream and connect
const result = await client.startStreamWithURL('rtsp://your-camera/stream');
if (result.success) {
    client.connect();
}

// Clean stop (only if no other clients)
const stopResult = await client.stopStream();
if (!stopResult.success && stopResult.conflict) {
    // Force stop if needed
    await client.forceStopStream();
}
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start the server**: `./rtsp-server`
2. **Open the example**: Open `client_example.html` in a browser
3. **Test reconnection**: Try disconnecting/reconnecting multiple times
4. **Test multiple clients**: Open multiple browser tabs
5. **Test force stop**: Try stopping streams with multiple clients connected

The server should no longer panic when clients disconnect or reconnect, and all operations should be handled gracefully.
